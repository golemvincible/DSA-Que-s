         * for this we are looping from j=0 to j<3
         * this means j will have value 0,1,2

         * so image we are dividing the array like this that means we can divide the array like this

         * for j = 0 -> {1} {15,7,9,2,5,10} now this both will be independent subproblems
         * for j = 1 -> {1,15} {7,9,2,5,10} now this both will be independent subproblems
         * for j = 2 -> {1,15,7} {9,2,5,10} now this both will be independent subproblems

         * now we will calculate answers for them and will select the maximum out of them

         * we are using this condition j<Math.min(k+i,arr.length) because
         * eg we are solving this subproblem {9,2,5,10} where i = 3 so cond. becomes j<min(6,7)
         * so for j=3 {9} {2,5,10}
         * for j=4 {9,2} {5,10}
         * for j=5 {9,2,5} {10}

         * then we will call the func for i=6
         * so cond. becomes j=6 ; j<min(9,7)
         * so we only have one element in array so we only need to solve for it that's why we are taking min
         * so we will solve for {10} subproblem

         * then calling the recursion for j+1 i.e j=7
         * b.c. will be reached (i==arr.length) and we'll get 0 returned
